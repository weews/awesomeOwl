Zombie

What kind of day was it yesterday
Was there anything special
I'm trying to remember
But nothing much comes to mind
 
Today goes by the same
Am I the only one struggling
How do I get through this
Would things get better if I cry my heart out
 
Yeah we live a life
Just running in circles all day and night
Yeah we live a life
Though I try to change something
I can't seem to do anything
And I've got nothing left here with me
 
I feel like I became a zombie
With an empty head and an empty heart
A scarecrow without a brain inside
Since when have I ended up like this? Oh why
 
I became a zombie
I walk on, drifting aimlessly
Tomorrow will be no different
I live counting the time 'til I close my eyes
 
Yeah we live a life
Eyes wide open in the dark
This meaningless life
Though I want to just let go
Though I want to just dream on
There's nothing I can do no more
 
I feel like I became a zombie
With an empty head and an empty heart
A scarecrow without a brain inside
Since when have I ended up like this? Oh why
I became a zombie
I walk on, drifting aimlessly
Tomorrow will be no different
I live counting the time 'til I close my eyes
 
Get it all out, Wanna cry
Let go of everything, Can I cry
Give me back my tears, they've run dry
Oh oh
 
I feel like I became a zombie
With an empty head and an empty heart
A scarecrow without a brain inside
Since when have I ended up like this? Oh why
I became a zombie
I walk on, drifting aimlessly
Tomorrow will be no different
I live counting the time 'til I close my eyes
