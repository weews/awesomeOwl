C++ object-oriented implementation of binary tree I wrote for students taking DM2126 Data Structures & Algorithm module at Nanyang Polytechnic, Singapore.

I have written an iterative version of Hibbard's delete node algorithm, which I find it rare among most implementations using recursion.

Thank you for your interest.

Cheers,
